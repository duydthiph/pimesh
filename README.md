# pimesh
configuration files and scripts to assist with creating an automatic raspberry pi meshing node using 802.11s.

These scripts depend on having a wifi adapter that can support both AP mode and mesh point at the same time.
The gateway mesh node needs to have Networkmanager installed and configured to ignore the wifi adapter used for meshing.

PS: these scripts are a mess and hack job......but they finally work reliably on my two raspberry pis.
